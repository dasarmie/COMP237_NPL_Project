1051,"FROM: DR. BEN KOKORICompliments of the season.  I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in this letter.  Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigeriaï¿½s Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !
and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companyï¿½s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companyï¿½s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.
It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.Best regards,BEN KOKORI
                                                                                                                  ",1

The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa
Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the
program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the United States.
A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United
States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at
a later time. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship.
You and your family could be lucky winners!

xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXThank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.Please call us at 1-2`8`1-5`0`0-4`0`1`8.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.

Have a BLAST in bed,
GUARANTEED!
Finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
 Naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
Good news, men! Recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: Maxamanâ„¢.
Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxamanâ„¢ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxamanâ„¢
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
What To
Expect:
1-2 weeks
 Most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. A noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.3-8 weeks
 By this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.9 weeks +
 After nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
Â 
Below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. See how you measure up...
How to measure your penis size
correctly: To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

is also an excellent circulatory and heart tonic and can help
dilate arteries. In India it is used as a tonic for the urinary
system.Ginseng Blend (Siberian, American & Korean) - Commonly used by athletes for overall body strengthening,
Ginseng fortifies the adrenal gland, and promotes healthy
circulation. It increases the conversion rate of sugars into the
necessary substrates for the formation of fatty acids in the liver.

antidote for fatigue.
Astragalus - Regarded as a potent
tonic for increasing energy levels and stimulating the immune
system, Astragalus has also been employed effectively as a

1106,"DEAR SIR/MADAMRE: BUSINESS ASSISTANCEI have decided to contact your assistance in relation to the following business proposal, having obtained your contact through the commercial attach of your country's embassy in South Africa. This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings.Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K!
. And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri!
bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed.Best Regards,
ROMILA KABILA

*******************************June 5 2002************************************************
I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 
So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 
With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  
Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 
Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 
Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated.  Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this99exit
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will dg43000sdasdfasdffgdfhyutdfsgttttrsdg
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

1127,"Hey there,If you're like me, you've tried EVERYTHING to lose
weight.  I know how you feel - the special diets,
miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped
me lose a pound either.  It seemed like the harder I tried,
the bigger I got, until I heard about a product called
Extreme Power Plus.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister swore it helped her lose 23 pounds in just two weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a shot.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made. Period.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and got permission to resell it - at a BIG discount.  I want
to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I give you my personal pledge that Extreme Power Plus
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU.  If it doesn't, you can return it
any time for a full refund.    If you are frustrated with trying other products, not having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - EXTREME
POWER PLUS.You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS, RESULTS, 
RESULTS!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's nothing to lose, and everything 
to gain.  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  That is my
pledge to you.  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

NO HYPEÂ… NO OBLIGATIONÂ…Introducing the Â“Look Good DuoÂ”Â…. Our EXCLUSIVEÂ”
NEW PATENTED PRODUCT is designed to REPAIR SKIN DAMAGE & REJUVENATE TISSUE! Successfully addresses WRINKLES, DARK CIRCLES, AGE SPOTS, FINE LINES, LESIONS, SPIDER VEINS, SKIN TAGS, SCAR TISSUE, CELLULITE, STRETCH MARKS, and MORE for most people the Â“LookGoodDuoÂ” is Hypoallergenic !Research, which began many years ago, has concluded that ellagic acid, derived from a compound called ellagitannins, is a very powerful substance. The highest concentration of ellagitannins are found in raspberry seeds. The delivery of the ellagitannins, however, is the key to the effectiveness of the product. We use raspberry seed materials processed using a patented method, which is the ONLY method that guarantees the maximum delivery of available phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants. Ellagic acid from raspberry seed ellagitannins is the most powerful and complete polyphenolic, phytoestrogen, antioxidant material yet discovered! These plant based compounds, or phytoestrogens, when absorbed, provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation. It is now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone the tiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemical pigment. The results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under the eyes. These materials also help to decrease the appearance of ""AGE"" brown spots, while smoothing WRINKLES, strengthening HAIR and NAILS, and supporting many other significant health issues! CELLULITE is simply FAT that is tethered down because certain cells in our skin are stimulated by estrogens. The phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants from both ORAL and TOPICAL sources of ellagic acid interfere with that tethering process resulting in a smoother skin surface. We offer this Patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream. Taken both internally and externally, it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly, working from the inside-out AND from the outside-in.  Happy users report a healthy Â“GLOWÂ” which they have never achieved with any other product! 
PRODUCT TESTIMONIALS I've been using the product for a little over a month. I took the ""2 face challenge', and I could tell a difference in only 3 days! The lines on my face and the pores had changed!  I have had people compliment my fingernails. They have been growing like crazy!  C.C., OHThis is a unique, one of a kind product.   I have been using it 3 weeks and I can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands. The prescription from my dermatologist didn't do it, but this product did.  M.F., MSI have been watching myself very closely, and since using the product, the brown spots on my hand have just about disappeared. The smile lines and the eyelids have really tightened up. No more problems putting my eyeliner on! The skin under my chin has really tightened up.  This is not hard work, it is just sharing the product with family and friends. I have never been rewarded so quickly and so well.   E.P., CAK.D., TX I was queen of skeptical.  I did not want to try this.  I am a 54 yr old grandmother.  I have tried everything for years to get rid of cellulite - the creams, the wraps - nothing worked.  My husband kept telling me to try this.  Finally I did it just to get him off my back.  I had not worn shorts for 5 years.  After about 10 days, my husband started telling me my legs were looking better.  I thought he was just being nice since he got me into this.   Then I went shopping, and in the lights in the dressing room, for the first time in a long time I looked pretty good.  I went into the next dressing room, because I thought the lights were wrong, but I still looked good.  I ended up buying shorts, and have been wearing shorts for the 1st time in 5 years.  Yes, it works!! G.C., TXWe just had a booth at the womenÂ’s expo in Dallas.  Out of the 300 or 400 exhibitors there, the only other spot that had the people we did were the ones giving out free food.   V.C., TXI did the 1 side of the face test, and I did not tell my spouse that I was doing it.  We went to get some  fast food.  He was looking at me, and said Â“I can tell you which side you are using it on.  ItÂ’s your right side.Â”  I asked what made him think so, and he said the lines around my mouth and eyes have softened, and the fine lines around my neck.  We are tickled, because everyone we talk to wants it!  J.D., TX Â“After using your product for less than a week, I ran into a friend who asked me what I was doing to look so YOUNG!  I have a full- time job, but I have made $8,000 since starting this business part time!Â“   T.H.,Tx
---------------------------------------
Â”I have found a system that works.  I have 44 people in my group in less than a month! In one month I made over $6,000! Â“ B.M., NH

Â”I am receiving 6 checks a month, and I do not even know where they are coming from!Â”  W.T., TX

Â”I have been in the company 3 weeks, and already have over 20 people in my group.  This is the easiest thing I have ever done.  All I do is tell them my story and give them the hotline number.Â” ---------------------------------------------------------------
At a restaurant, I went to the restroom with a girlfriend and was telling her about what this product does.  We went back to the table, and in a few minutes 2 women walked up to me.  They said they were in the stalls and overheard us talking, and wanted some of the product.  I gave them a brochure, and noticed they went to 2 different tables.  They weren't even together!

A national weekly

there are ""absolutely  NO Laws

The simple instructions, they are bound to
make some mega bucks
With only $25 out of pocket cost"". DUE TO
THE RECENT INCREASE
OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS

profitable
Opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each
Time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally
joined just to see
What one could expect in return for the
minimal effort and
Money required. To my astonishment, I
received a total of

coming in.""
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and
AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION
BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
TRUE,
GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list
below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE
NAME & NUMBER
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING
and YOUR E-
MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the
report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON
YOUR
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case
of any mail
problems.=== When you place your order, make sure
you order each of
the 5 reports.  You will need all 5 reports so
that you can save
them on your  computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL
COST $5 X 5=$25.00.Within a few days you will receive, vie e-
mail, each of the 5
reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your
computer so they  will be accessible for you
to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a
floppy of these reports and keep them on
your desk in case
something happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of
the people who
are listed next to each report, or their
sequence on the list, in
any way other than what is instructed
below in step '' 1
through 6 '' or you will loose the majority of
your profits.
Once you understand the way this works,
you will also see
how it does not work if you change it.
Remember, this
method has been tested, and if you alter, it
will NOT work !!!
People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all
five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not
work this way. Believe us, we all have tried
to be greedy and
then nothing happened. So Do Not try to
change anything
other than what is instructed. Because if
you do, it will not
work for you.Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports,
take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name &

To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the
5 reports you purchase will provide you with
invaluable
marketing information which includes how
to send bulk e-
mails legally, where to find thousands of
free classified ads
and much more. There are 2 Primary
methods to get this
venture going: METHOD # 1: BY
SENDING BULK E-MAIL
LEGALLY===============================
=============Let's say that you decide to start small, just
to see how it goes,
and we will assume You and those
involved send out only
5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that
the mailing receive
only a 0.2% response (the response could
be much better but
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many
people will send out
hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of
only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out
only 5,000 e-
mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report #
1. Those 10 people responded by sending
out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those
50,000 e-mails only
0.2% responded with orders.
That's=100 people responded and ordered
Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of
500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for
Report # 3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 5
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response
to that is 10,000
orders for report #4.  Those 10,000 people
send out 5,000 e-
mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50
million) e-mails. The
0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report  # 5.
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5
EACH=$500,000.00
(half million).Your total income in this example is: 1.....
$50 + 2..... $500 +
3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000
....... Grand
Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL
& PAPER AND
FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
RESPONSES AND
NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT,
YOU WILL
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !===============================
=============REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS
ASSUMING ONLY 10
PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU
MAILED TO.
Dare to think for a moment what would
happen if everyone or
half or even one 4th of those people mailed
100,000e-mails
each or more? There are over 150 million
people on the
Internet worldwide and counting. Believe
me, many people
will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 :
BY PLACING
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET===============================
=============Disclaimer: Your earnings and results are highly dependent on your
individual efforts and results. This web page constitutes no guarantees
of any income, whether stated nor implied. Any earnings projections
shown on this website are for example and educational purposes only.
Actual results will vary according to each individual member's activity. In
general, the more you work the plan the better your results.Advertising on the net is very very
inexpensive and there are
hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads
on the Internet will easily get a larger
response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and
METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you
must do is e-mail
them the Report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same
day service on all orders. This will
guarantee that the e-mail
they send out, with your name and address
on it, will be
prompt because they can not advertise until
they receive the
report.=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS
============ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS
NUMBER & NAME
ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S.
CURRENCY) for
each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed
by wrapping it in at
least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those
sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report
you are ordering,
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name
and postal
address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS
GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your
success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders
for Report #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2
to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If
you did not, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you
do.=== Once you have received 100 or more
orders for Report #
2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system
is already working
for you, and the cash will continue to roll in !
THIS IS
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on
the list, you are
placed in front of a Different report. You can
KEEP TRACK
of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-
MAILS AND
START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO
LIMIT to the income you can generate
from this business !!!===============================
=============FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE
ORIGINATOR OF
THIS PROGRAM: You have just received
information that
can give you financial freedom for the rest
of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks
and months than you
have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any
way. It works
exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting
report after you
have put your name and address in Report
#1 and moved
others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed
above. One of the people
you send this to may send out 100,000 or
more e-mails and
your name will be on every one of them.Remember though, the more you send out
the more potential
customer you will reach. So my friend, I
have given you the
ideas, information, materials and
opportunity to become
financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU
NOW !======== MORE TESTIMONIALS
============""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I
live in Chicago. I
am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received this
program I grumbled
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made
fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and
percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't
work. Jody totally
ignored my supposed intelligence and few
days later she
jumped in with both feet. I made merciless
fun of her, and was
ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her
when the thing didn't
work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3
weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all
cash! I was
shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.
Mitchell Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois===============================
===========''Not being the gambling type, it took me
several weeks to
make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative
that I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that
there was just no way that I wouldn't get
enough orders to at
least get my money back''. '' I  was
surprised when I found my
medium size post office box  crammed with
orders. I made
$319,210.00in the first 12 weeks.  The nice
thing about this
deal is that it does not matter where 
people live. There simply
isn't a better investment with a faster return
and so big."" Dan
Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada===============================
============''I had received this program before. I
deleted it, but later I
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of
course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so
I had to wait until I
was e-mailed again by someone
else.........11 months passed
then it luckily came again...... I did not
delete this one! I made
more than $490,000 on my first try and all
the money came
within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New
York, N.Y.===============================
=============''It really is a great opportunity to make
relatively easy money
with little cost to you. I followed the simple
instructionscarefully and within 10 days the money
started to come in. My
first month I made $20,560.00 and by the
end of third month
my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life
is beautiful, Thanks
to the internet."". Fred Dellaca, Westport,

E-Mail:dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com
LAGOS - NIGERIA. ATTN:  
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. It is with my profound dignity that I write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ""TOP SECRET"".
Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. We
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. However, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. I
am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department
Of Petroleum 
Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract
Award Panel incharge
of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top
Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties
include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of
Contract jobs
done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your Account
the said funds. The source of this funds is as
follows: In the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of Oil Pipe lines
in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my
colleagues and I
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431
million United
States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service
Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in Government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. I have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are
writing you this
letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31
million), while
70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to
say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. You must however NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based 
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below; 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence 
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody, or any form of blackmail. 
d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release
the funds as instructed 
by us after you have removed your share of 20% from
the total amount. 
Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude
this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days
from the date 
of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .
We are looking 
forward to doing business with you and solicit your
Total Confidentiality
in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I
give you my word that you
are completely safe in doing business with us.
Transactions like this
have been successfully carried out in the past by
most Government
executives. Here in my country there is great
economic and political
disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant
and the order of
the day, thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how
money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because
everyone is
making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future, so that when
we retire from active service we donot languish in
poverty. I will
explain more to you when I have heard from you. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e-mail address. 
I will bring you into the complete picture of this
pending business
transaction when I have heard from you and also
receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me
fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our
pending business
transaction. I will also send to you my private
telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me. Your urgent
response will be
highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds
under the second
quarter of the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless. Yours faithfully, Dr.tom eke. N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS
TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL
AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY
LAUNDERING. THIS IS A
COMPLETE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

Have a BLAST in bed,
GUARANTEED!
Finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
 Naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
Good news, men! Recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: Maxamanâ„¢.
Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxamanâ„¢ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxamanâ„¢
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
What To
Expect:
1-2 weeks
 Most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. A noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.3-8 weeks
 By this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.9 weeks +
 After nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
Â 
Below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. See how you measure up...
How to measure your penis size
correctly: To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

this hard-to-find information. So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 
 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!Please Click the URL for the Detail! http://%77%77%77%2E%62a%6E%6E%65%64c%64%2E%6E%65%74{%RAND%}

you might be interested in this. A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
seriously.Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 2000
PAID members in my downline!As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2365 people.You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS.
My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your downline grow?To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:gitrman@excite.com
and write this phrase:
""Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your Free Member Number.I'll get you entered and let you know how you can
keep track of your growing downline.That's all there's to it.I'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.Warm regards,Bruce StevensP.S. After having several negative experiences with network

The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa
Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the
program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the United States.
A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United
States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at
a later time. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship.
You and your family could be lucky winners!

              ï¿½Most investors desire to be in a stock from the beginning 
              of its growth, ï¿½IBXGï¿½ is one of those opportunities. 
              Revenues to increase over 500 % 
              to over $18 Million from $3 Million with its 
              pending acquisition of 47 physical therapy outpatient centers and 
              institutional pharmacy businesses, currently owned by CyberCare, 
              Inc. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ also just announced a national alliance

              spiraling out of control. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ provides technology 
              based products and services in full compliance with newly mandated 
              government requirements (HIPAA), that help medical professionals

              The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
              (Publicï¿½Lawï¿½104-191), 
              also known as HIPAA, was enacted as part of a broad Congressional 
              attempt at incremental healthcare reform. Part of the law requires 
              the US Dept. of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to develop standards 
              and requirements for maintenance and transmission of health information 
              that identifies individual patients. The requirements outlined by 
              the law are far-reaching for all healthcare organizations that maintain 
              or transmit electronic health information must comply. ï¿½IBXGï¿½

1205,"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even

classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.

BELOW WHOLESALENEW, AND IN QUANTITIES YOU NEED
A SINGLE UNIT, A PALLET,
  OR A TRUCKLOAD1. Do you consider yourself ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
2. Are you still looking for a very Real Business that can provide you and
  your family with the lifestyle you desire and deserve? Or,just a second
  income in your spare time?3. Would you invest $66.50 (A 25% discount off of our regular price of
  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
If so, read on:
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.Â Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
There was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""
The hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.
If you are TIRED OF LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, and are willing to
  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.

  substantial income. Keep in mind, everyone likes a bargain, and even more so
  when the economy is down. So, even if you just want to buy for your own use, a
  single purchase could repay your initial investment. And, remember we provide
  a 30day, full refund satisfaction guarantee.

1219,"SUBJECT: 
                   Urgent Concern Pls.I am a serious officer with one of our main branches of CITI BANK,
consumer Banking Department. Although we didn't have previous correspondence till date.
However, based on the standard value place on everything about you,  I believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.The transaction is thus:
I've a wealthy client, an American Citizen who had been residing in West Africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which I am his account officer, and also 
receives standing orders  for his chains of dividends share.
However, this client Mr. David Brown died as an  out come of Heart attack,and the funds in his current account has  been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to USA.
At the end of Fiscal year, March 2001, an  accumulated share of US$12.360M was transferred into his account from the Stock Exchange.
This was alone the instructions we issued to the Stock House to dispose all his stocks.Now the funds has arrived, I needed an associate whom I would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. Associate partner of Mr. David Brown so as to receive this fund.
Please note, his family has left since,and never  know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his Fix Deposit Account, so I as the account officer 
has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund.
Immediately, you reach me, I will furnish you  with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. It will be of 
need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax  numbers for urgent
messages. 
I am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. Be guided.Thanking you .Yours sincerely,Dave Framo.

erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time
mailing, so no removal is necessary. If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level
marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most
important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The
pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their
friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is
fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. HERE'S GOOD NEWS There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't
yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of
income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell
you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard
of this before. I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the
information. Period. To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type
""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to
you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your
Inbox. Cordially, Looking4Money P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And
it's FREE!

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

1238,"What have you been up to?
I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of going
down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges
cost more than the printer itself! I know how you feel
- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is
a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got
to stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies
anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!
Well, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Gosh darn, not another
cheap knockoff printer cartridge!""Â  Like you, I was very 
skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate
said it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. 
So I tried it.Â  I mean, there was nothing to lose because they
offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty
on all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!
Let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
Period.Â  Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,
I've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies
to Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or
service that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,
the service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since 
I started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement
within 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!I was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer
and got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount.Â  I want
to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies
like I did. Because a penny saved is a penny earned! 
I give you my personal pledge the SUPERINK soltuion will absolutely
WORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return your order anytime
for a full refund.Â  Â  If you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the
printer companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,
then I recommend - the SUPERINK solution.You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how do we save all this money
without losing quality and service?""Modern technology has provided SUPERINK with unique, revolutionary
methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which
prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and
handling. Nothing ""magic"" about it - just quality & savings, BIG SAVINGS!Here is the bottom line ...I can help you save 30%-70% per week/per month/per year or per lifetime 
by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies. Just try it once, you'll 
keep coming back - there's nothing to lose, and much MONEY to be saved! 
100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. You will be able to print as much as you
want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - GUARANTEED.
That is my pledge to you.Â  To order from the SUPERINK Solution on our secure server, just click

Major Medical 
            BreakthroughHuge Profit Potential
Imagine yourself as part owner of the 
      most interesting, full service state-of-the-art medical facility, equipped 
      with the most sophisticated and effective scanning diagnostic tools 
      available today.
Electron Beam Tomography is a 
      cutting-edge diagnostic technology capable of providing a 
      crystal-ball-like look into your medical future. This technology has been 
      featured on Oprah, Larry King, Good Morning America, and USA 
      Today.
EBT Scans are now covered by most health 
      insurance companies and HMOs, causing an explosion in usership and 
      exceptionally high demand for this procedure.
EBT can identify heart disease years 
      before a treadmill test would show an abnormality and many years before a 
      heart attack might occur.
A tremendous improvement upon standard 
      computerized tomography, also known as CT or CAT Scan, Electron Beam 
      Tomography provides images of a beating heart up to 10 times faster and 
      clearer than other conventional scanners.
The dramatic capabilities of this 
      spectacular technology should provide an extraordinary investment 
      opportunity for those establishing state-of-the-art outpatient clinics, in 
      order to provide the EBT body scan procedures to health conscious 
      Americans. Projected 10-year return of 916%.
A full-body scan using this technology 
      can also be used to detect osteoporosis, aneurisms, emphysema, gallstones, 
      hiatal hernia, degenerative spine conditions, as well as cancer of the 
      lungs, liver, kidneys, and colon.
Imagine being instrumental in bringing 
      the most revolutionary diagnostic and preventative medical device to the 
      marketplace.

Email: ronardtony@mail.com
Dear Sir, REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains
unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money. However, with my being in direct charge of
Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late
Dr.David Fang' on private business deal basis. Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- (a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang (b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax 
number for details on how to proceed. For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship. Regards,

Date: Not suppliedPro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's.""     ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video 
    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit.""

Date: 2002-10-06T21:28:33-06:00Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
Pipeline[1] Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. ""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""[1] http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/pipeline0.html

hidden surface removal (HSR), different techniques being suitable for different 
game genres. For example, action games played in closed-in locations need an 
engine allowing fast rendering of a few hundred polygons, a high frame rate, 
and a high level of details to impress players. Conversely, a game that is 
taking place outdoors requires quite a different approach. This features

Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. *Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" *Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.",0

Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. â€œTrying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.â€ I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS controlâ€”also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI

sort of way. The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"". - Download MT 2.5[3].

Date: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00=== Scissors === I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing.     The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  === Waiting for Wireless === Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. === Irony === According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. === Automatic Flush Toilets === Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. === Arrival === I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties. Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)",0

Date: 2002-10-08T12:28:10-05:00_Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be 
rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to 
design a â€œnovelty formatâ€ to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might 
look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: - It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify 
required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown 
number of parsers around the world. 
- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, 
thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. 
- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such 
egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an 
obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. 
- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core 
namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely 
resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. 
- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its 
add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the 
spec would neither define nor elaborate on. 
- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements 
semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also 
fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the 
same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers 
and inconsistent behavior across consumers. RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. 
For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's 
pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication 
format, we have the worst one possible. Except, of course, for all the others. The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of 
necessitiesâ€”RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format 
has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very 
weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it 
possible in the first place. - Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened 
up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. 
- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing 
content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce 
valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social 
mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally 
introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable 
display through unclosed HTML elements. 
- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't 
matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages 
where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes 
and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out 
in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more 
flexibility. Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious 
computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type 
Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made 
it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this 
ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts 
over the years to â€œdo RSS rightâ€â€”most notably RSS 1.0 in the 
year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: - Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which 
fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. 
- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at 
the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years 
later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with 
parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF 
parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version 
is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) 
Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts 
recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to 
actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise 
of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 
feedâ€”in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the 
worldâ€”by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets 
into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. 
- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been 
haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be 
flourishing. Evolvable formatsâ€”those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a 
thousand small waysâ€”have three main characteristics that are germane to 
their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. - Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. 
My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a 
TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know 
nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is 
littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. 
If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would 
be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such 
perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. 
There is no middle ground. 
- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to 
earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, 
they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long 
descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such 
practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle 
them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it 
faces. 
- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie 
Orgelâ€”â€œEvolution is cleverer than you areâ€. As with the list 
of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with 
any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 
0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 
â€œdid things rightâ€. However, the ability to understand what is 
missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central 
group can design a better system in the long haul. Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable 
formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect 
syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. 
Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, 
partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.[1] http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html

Date: Not suppliedFeedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. *""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. *""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. *""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""
*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html

the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the â€œshort 
loopâ€ I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, â€œLook, another 
runner... not smiling!â€ This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.",0

Sunday, December 1, 2002Driver who hit moose fights county over meatBy GISELLE GOODMAN, Portland Press Herald Writer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
via http://www.lorencoleman.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTON Â‹ In her freezer at home, Lisa Pierce has ground beef and roasts,
frozen vegetables and french fries, even a couple of Popsicles. What she
doesn't have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on
Nov. 5, the moose that was rightfully hers, but instead went to a neighbor.The lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the York County Sheriff's
Department to get back what she says she is owed.""I think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor,"" said Pierce. ""I'm a
woman and he just neglected to think that I would want it. The moose is
gone, I know that now. I want to be compensated for the meat.""Whether or not that happens is uncertain. Her experience, though, highlights
a law some Mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during this
peak time of deer-versus-car accidents, as the animals, in their mating
season, come out of the woods.The law is simple: A big-game carcass caught by a car - be it a moose, deer
or bear - goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcement
officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident.It comes up quite often in Maine, say officials. Last year, there were 4,055
cases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads and 600 accidents
involving moose, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Warden
Service.""In a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, I
don't know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a
moose,"" said Latti. ""You do have the option of keeping it.""Which, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car.
Farm-grown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. And a
butchered or dressed moose, which can't be bought or sold anywhere in Maine,
can produce hundreds of pounds of food.Latti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since its
inception in 1991. Every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a
driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. That kind of ""hunting""
makes no sense to Latti.Hitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. Large adult
moose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. Since
the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodies
often come crashing through windshields in collisions. More often than not,
crashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal.Sometimes they are fatal. In 1998, Latti said, there were six moose-related
fatalities. After that, when the number of moose-hunting permits went from
2,000 to 3,000, there were less. Maine had three moose-related fatalities in
2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said Stephen McCausland,
spokesman for the Maine Public Safety Department.Pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car
did not become part of that statistic early on Election Day. But she also
feels cheated by the whole situation. After all, her car was totaled.On the morning of the accident, Pierce was taking her two children and a
neighbor's son to school in her 1991 Dodge Dynasty. She said she was going
along at about 35 mph on a well-traveled road, when a moose came out of
nowhere.""By the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield,"" she
said. Pierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with the
children, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose.
But the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal
with it, so she said she wasn't able to follow up on the animal until later
that day.When she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the
fully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor.Her neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 it
took him to carry it away, money she didn't think she should spend. By the
time she contacted the Attorney General's Office on Nov. 12 to complain
about the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had gone up
another $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat.And when she called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complain
that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer's
fault that she didn't have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cash
and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in York
County.""At that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, but
wanting money,"" Ouellette said.That conversation, and a similar one she had with York County Sheriff Phil
Cote, left Pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the
moose.But the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to
other officials.""It's the officer's discretion,"" said Latti. ""And if the officer feels the
person can't immediately remove (the animal), he's got to think of public
safety and other people on the roadway. If someone is worried about her
children in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask
is if she wants the moose.""Maine State Police Trooper Jeremy Forbes said when he arrives at accidents
that involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal,
deer or moose, becomes secondary.""The priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital,"" he
said. ""If they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can't
wait, so we'll probably give it to the next person who stops by.""This is not comforting to Pierce. She said the deputy could have come to the
ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. With her
boyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animal
herself.She knows her situation is probably a lost cause. But she hopes other
people, especially other women, do not have the same experience.""What about people who don't know the law?"" she said. ""Standing up for my
rights has just been a big headache.""Staff Writer Giselle Goodman can be contacted at 324-4888 or at:ggoodman@pressherald.com

4333,"The material appended below comes from Martin Gardner's
book _Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science_ -- revised
and expanded edition published in 1957 by Dover Publications,
Inc. (New York City).Bill Bennetta
_________________________________________________""[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in
common.        ""First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful
contacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists
that his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,
to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new
ideas. . . .        ""The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside
the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are
introduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not
send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they
are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases
are excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the
reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,
to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he
himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may
edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.        ""A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which
greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward
paranoia. . . .        ""There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-
scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.        ""(1) He considers himself a genius.        ""(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as
ignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore
him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels. . . .        ""(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against. . . .        ""(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories.  When
Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works
in that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with
Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .        ""(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined. . . .""

(can't remember which one tho') was doing this a long time ago.http://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/02Dec2002_biz54.html=====
Postcards from Planet GoogleINTERNET: The search engine is taking snapshots of its users' minds and 
aggregating them. So what is the world thinking about?JENNIFER 8. LEEAt Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, 
transfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the 
receptionist's desk: animacio{AAC}n japonese Harry Potter pense{AAC}es 
et poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas.The projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what 
people around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The 
terms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, 
French, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks.The scrolling continues: people who shouldn't marry ``she smoked a 
cigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto 
theft fraud how to.Stare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the 
collective consciousness of the world stream by.Each line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet 
connection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more 
than 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer 
logs millisecond by millisecond.Google is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.So what is the world thinking about?Sex, for one thing.``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking 
at the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. 
(To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, 
though less successfully with foreign languages.)Despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much 
of its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble 
to the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what 
they are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of 
Google's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and 
protecting the data record.Google's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has 
given Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has 
been able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including 
milzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell 
which countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and 
Germany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the 
globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are 
far-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.Judging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost 
everywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race 
and the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last 
year. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music 
and celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a 
Google engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney 
Spears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her 
popularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of 
the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.Glancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural 
literacy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and 
girlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list 
recently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose 
members was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and 
fentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages 
taken by Chechen rebels in late October).The long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney 
Spears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them 
understand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she 
broke up with Justin Timberlake.Google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more 
serious nature, immediately.On Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 
am local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to 
250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific 
Northwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and 
CNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, 
Nostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that 
Nostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.But the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive 
cultural seismic meter.The logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden 
name'' had surged to the top of the charts.Curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they 
were neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes 
after the hour.As the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. 
Why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s 
sitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not 
explain them.That is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena 
per se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a 
member of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what 
else is going on in the world.''So what had gone on on April 22, 2001?That night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be 
a Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds 
after the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to 
search for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was 
broadcast successively in each US time zone.The precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some.``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said 
Sergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford 
helped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. 
``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.''Predictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and 
radio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. 
One of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends 
before they hit the radar of other media.As such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or 
retailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for 
commercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is 
tremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The 
challenge is defining what we want to do.''Google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data 
because of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, 
originating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to 
a specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People 
tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly 
_ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the 
aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual.In aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next 
to Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a 
three-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being 
used around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots 
shooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey 
the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest 
flames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area.Each country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy 
have a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely 
lunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when 
phone rates for dial-up modems drop.Google's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and 
phenomena as they hop from country to country.Take Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in 
Spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking 
dance similar to the Macarena.Like a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated 
through Europe over the summer and fall.The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 
countries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches 
began a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the 
Netherlands.Haven't heard of Las Ketchup?If you haven't, Google predicts you soon will.

4338,"Jets Attempt to Intercept 'Contrail' By ROBERT BURNS
AP Military Writer WASHINGTON (AP)--The military command responsible for the defense of North
American airspace scrambled fighter jets in response to unverified reports
of an airborne condensation trail, or contrail, moving from the Caribbean to
the United States, defense officials said Thursday. Lt. Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened
Wednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., was continuing to investigate. The reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it
could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or
approaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the
Pentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. A contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold
air. The jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source
of the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD
spokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial
report at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking
radars in search of evidence, he said. A Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what
appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,'' originally in the vicinity of
the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. ``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United
States,'' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the
contrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings
were reported.'' The reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the
Pentagon statement said. At the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I'm
aware of the reports.'' He referred all questions to NORAD. Jenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the
Caribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or
from which military bases they were scrambled. ``We don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to
investigate'' a contrail, he said. Meanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday
had people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations
with calls reporting a meteor shower. It was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,
Neb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian
rocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details.

4342,"Raymond L. Wallace, 83
Bigfoot Story Teller
(1919-2002)Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
home.It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray WallaceÂ¹s
company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called Â³Bigfoot.Â²  Crew
took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to todayÂ¹s
global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
Bigfoot mystery.In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
Â³care and respectÂ² and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
came forth with a baby Bigfoot.Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
State, on November 30, 2002.Â©Loren Coleman 2002

4351,"One of the main strands of this 'modernisation' is to have all stations on a 'retained' basis at night. Basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire, the fire-fighters will be summonsed by pagers, the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions. The main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night. However, the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire-fighters' strike all occurred at night. Over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren't on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come. Currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live/work within one mile of the station. How they will apply this to whole time fire-fighters is still unclear. A good friend of mine is a station officer in Hampshire and currently lives 20 miles from his station so how he'll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery.  And I can't see many fire-fighters living within a mile of some of the inner London stations.DaveTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

Dec. 1, 2002KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
as she rode an escalator here, police said.Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law
forbidding people from creating a public nuisance.Hamano admits to the allegations.Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at
JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted
to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter.
She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs.

ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
originated in the Middle East.""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""It is then explained: ""He had paid Â£625 to a local sorcerer and 
believed that he was invisible.""In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
three walls to steal Â£10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.""The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
between the back hallway and the front shop.""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
contents.""The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
left in his store and is quoted as saying: ""On Monday morning when my 
wife was opening, everything looked normal.""But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
shop next door.""The paper reports that the shop was the target of ""another well 
organised crime"" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.The shop's owner says: ""The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
people are going to be open to this.""The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
Down Democrat.Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.He is shocked at reports of the ""wanton destruction by vandals"" and 
issues a call for action.""The time has come to fight fire with fire,"" he writes, ""before 
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.""As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
controlled violence.""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
liberal who may oppose his plan.""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
the order of the day.""You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
the late 1980s.""However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
it numerically passes Christianity.""

>    but let's walk before we run - after all, we may end up
>    all using Zodb in any case :-)I'd like this (despite the additional installation burden - we can ship
binaries for Windows and Mac) and not only for technical reasons.  As I
understand it, post-1.8x versions of the core bsddb code ship under the
Sleepycat license, which demands that projects using it must be
published-source.  This is a problem if we want Spambayes to be fully
PSF-licensed - if someone wants to take the Spambayes source and fund their
addictions by creating a commercial, closed-source spam-filter product, the
PSF license allows that but not if the code relies on bsddb.  Not that I'm
in favour of people making money from Spambayes (unless it's me 8-) but the
PSF license does allow for it - it should be all or nothing.  Or do I have
this all wrong?Slightly OT: This has concerned me since PLabs announced that they were
integrating bsddb into Python 2.3 - it's going to make it very easy
(especially on Windows) for someone to write code that uses anydbm, wrap it
up with Py2exe and ship it under a commercial license, not knowing that
they're breaking the Sleepycat license.  They've never heard of Sleepycat
Software or even bsddb - as far as they're concerned, this ""bsddb.pyd"" file
that Py2exe tells them they need to ship is just another part of Python,
like _socket.pyd or select.pyd.--

   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Read it like this: new array with 1024 elements of type pointer to char.
As a pointer occupies the natural word size (32 bits or 64bits), no wonder
you get 4*1024 (sizeof(char *) * numer_of_elements).>  int len = sizeof(testbuff);

sizeof returns the size of types. You can use it with vars (and then the
normal form is sizeof var, not sizeof(var)), but if you're changing the
type with the var with a cast, of course you'll get the size of that new
type.Regards,
Luciano Rocha-- 
Consciousness: that annoying time between naps.

4375,"No, you need to learn how declarations work in C.  You have specified
testbuff as ""an array of 1024 pointers to characters"".  That means,
you have allocated an array big enough to store 1024 pointers.  On
most machines, that's 4 bytes per pointer, which indeed would give you

 University boom creates era of sexual tolerance By Helen Rumbelow
 
 
 
 THE boom in university education has led to a sea change in BritainÂ’s
 tolerance of homosexuality, according to a report. Just under half the people
 now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three
 quarters 15 years ago, according to the British Social Attitudes survey,
 regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion. 
 
 That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities, with 75 per
 cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced, compared
 with 60 per cent in 1987. 
 
 Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, decided to focus on
 what has caused Britain to become more open-minded in a report published
 today. The study, from the National Centre for Social Research, is based on
 interviews with a cross-section of 3,500 people. 
 
 Young people are much more tolerant than their elders, with a quarter of
 twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong, compared with
 two thirds of pensioners. 
 
 But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college, with
 graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs, and a
 third less racist. 
 
 That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from
 and, with 41 per cent of young people now attending university, it was a
 powerful social effect, Professor Evans said. 
 
 Â“Mr BlairÂ’s famous mantra Â‘education, education, educationÂ’ seems far less
 consequential now than when first announced in 1997, as Britain struggles with
 an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people
 get degrees, degrees buy less and less,Â” he said. 
 
 Â“But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the
 undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance,Â” he added. 
 
 He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just
 Â“political correctnessÂ” by testing how many civil rights the educated would
 give to an unattractive minority: white supremacists. 
 
 Again, people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and
 university, with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists
 should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections,
 three times as many as those with no qualifications. 
 
 It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant, the report
 says, adding that it may be simply because university students have increased
 contact with alternative points of view. 
 
 Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their
 idealism, but found the opposite to be true. 
 
 Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong
 with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties. He
 said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older
 generation, Britain would become an ever more relaxed place. 
 
 Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability, with more than half
 the country wanting cannabis to be legalised, compared with a third seven
 years ago. That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread,
 with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it. 
 
 A third of Labour voters, twice as many as Conservatives, had tried the drug,
 and being young, living in London and having a degree also increased the
 chances. 
 
 One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs. Most take a strong position on
 heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years. Now the proportion of
 people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept
 up to 97 per cent. 
 
 Â“The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal
 free-for-all,Â” Alison Park, co-director of the study, said. Â“People are making
 quite a clear distinction between what they think (of) as right and wrong.Â” 
 
 On other matters, the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think
 that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits Â— in
 fact, they account for 6 per cent; that union membership has fallen by a fifth
 in the past 18 years, with just under a third of workers in a union; and that
 half those questioned oppose secondary school selection. In 1984 the figure
 was 40 per cent. 
 
 The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live
 with their parents, twice as many as women.

Bomber targets Dutch Ikea storesPolice in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
""We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today,"" said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
""We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously,"" she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone

Possible?  Any possible hacks?

4391,"Man killed 'trying to surf' on Tube train 
Ananova 
Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AM
An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to ""surf"" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
""We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened,"" said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as ""non-suspicious."" To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with.   There's obviously a way as the ""Sequences"" menu does this.
The ""Mark Unseen"" menu entry in the message ""More"" menu is still wanting
that function as well...  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
  | display the other sequences.Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...I have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
the ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the

4409,"Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
all. Thanks for your suggestions.Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
fan.I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stgÂ£133.86)
but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3Â½"" drive bays so I should be ok for
future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
is big and has loads of room inside.
Oh... and it looks very cool :-)However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
* ATX Power supply sold separatelyIn fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
that show) but I missed that :-)I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.

It isn't a ""version"" of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob.
It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit's atop Mach and
uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn't really a BSD.(Here's a neat trick, touch ""Makefile"" and ""makefile"", notice the lack of
error message but the absence of ""makefile"", and don't bother formatting for
UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,
implemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get's tweaked every
now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there
somewhere down the road. )Then there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
environment.As for your initial question,

Mark.

hmm. there are versions of OpenBSD that run from a 32M compact flash IIRC.and antefacto's software ran in 64M.there are CF->IDE adapters anyway, so get a 256M CF (100â‚¬+), mount it RO,
and use that?/me is also in the market for one of the 60W fanless PSU's that antefacto had,
if someone wants to get a few of them.L.

Mandrake translated to Basque (and release all the changes), so that you
can just install it and the desktop and apps can be in your language. I
think that whichever organization (Irish government I suppose) is in
charge of promoting Irish here could learn a lot from them. The Basque government used to pay MS for translating Windows, but they
got pissed off because it was extremely expensive and the translations
would come out when the software was already obsolete. Now they promote
Free Software while helping the language at the same time, I think it's
a win-win situation ;).cheers,

out of the office has leaked! i think it would be best if we all
email the ""Systems Manager"" as a matter of urgency. in lieu of an
email address i suggest emailling all of postmaster, info, sales,
hostmaster, webmaster, support and accounts (and any other address
one can think of).now, considering the critical nature of this leak, if you do not 
receive an adequate reply i think one would be duty bound to raise 
the matter again, and again if needs be, until one gets a 
satisfactory reply.also, i notice a lot of people on this lot who post from company 
addresses do not have disclaimers on their emails. i would encourage 
everyone in a professional position to raise the matter of 
disclaimers internally and ensure that disclaimers are implemented 
for company emails, stationary and phone systems.finally, the email-disclaimers advocacy site 	http://www.emaildisclaimers.com/may prove to be a useful resource. rather strangely one of the quotes 
on the front-page of their site is:	'The disclaimers added to the end of emails are not legally 
	binding, but it's always good practice to try and disclaim liability'	-- Michael Chissick, Head of Internet law at Field Fisher 
	WaterhouseHowever, i suggest this quote, partly the initial part, be ignored
and that other more favourable quotes (by self-aggrandising
pundits^W^Wleading experts)  be heeded instead.  Also, there is a
vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large
company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some
kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having
implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a

actual /legal/ opinion on the web i've found on the web indicates:1. they should be used /sparingly/blanket pre/appending of disclaimers /dilutes/ any legal
effectiveness they have.2. they are not binding, and have little meaning other than in 
certain situations.they are not binding. though there are some situations where for proffessional reasons one
may wish to indicate the standing of an email. (eg legal advice ""this
is / is not legal advice"" type of thing. But again, this means 
disclaimers need to context-specific. (see 1.)3. there is precedence that blanket disclaimers, under UK law, have 
no standing and that rather (common sense this) it is the context of 
the situation that determines the legal effects of an email.See the norwich union case. Anyway, my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers 
to see sense:1. server side appends breaks email standards. (unless always done 
correctly - nearly impossible, cause then server has to understand 
every possible type of client encoding).1a. it /does/ break certain types of encryption, that depend on the 
body being untouched. (eg X.509? kate brought this up ages ago).1b. iirc, it contravenes MIME to pre/append non mime-typed text. Most 
mailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some 
might not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the 
disclaimer might not be displayed.1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this 
also allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate 
context (or no disclaimer at all).2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness. 
(dilution, NU case in UK)3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed
it will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is
confidential' on list mail). see 1c. Also, it needs to be written by 
an actual lawyer.4. A lot of big multinational corporations do /not/ append 
disclaimers. (ones i know of: Compaq (deceased), Motorol (iirc), 
Microsoft (iirc)).Useful link:http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/
(and see links at bottom of this page).finally, if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agree to
implementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to:	""that'll be done just as soon as the company stationary has
	disclaimers printed on them. oh, and i guess we'll have to play a
	disclaimer before or after all our telephone calls too?

books, the exact same basket of books cost more in both .de and
.fr (taking delivery charges, VAT et al into account) than buying
the same thing in amazon.co.ukThe books I used to check were 
1) C unleashed (Heathfield et al)
2) Design Patterns (Gamma et al)
3) Computer Graphics, principles and practice (Foley et al)I was hugely surprised that amazon.co.uk worked out cheapest - by
a considerable margin, too - something like 12 euros after
freight was taken into account.Cheers,

Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screeningTo all,I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa
Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate
IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend
the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen
REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to
hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am
trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I
would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print
of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a
theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to
quickly set up a screening for its members.I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I
originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of
REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and
none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open
Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another
SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter
to Hobbyists.  The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,
but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open
Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about
the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a
vegetarian.  I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects
worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many
aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary
on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be
punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by
having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my
feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you
see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing
is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. 
However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at
home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a
university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized
screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I
believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should
retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement
is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of
the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin
selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a
license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use
the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the
DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford
to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of
preserving the educational/institutional market.Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists
that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the
artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of
REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. 
It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked
full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will
get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek
out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for
REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you
will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested
persons to legally view it.I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening
at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.Sincerely,J.T.S. Moore
Director, REVOLUTION OS

duly noteddefinately would make the extra effort to talk directly with these people
and mention to the IFC (local arts cinema) about a more approriate
showing.Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs
of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning.Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already.I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer
cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.Is this the same film the 2600 people are always going on about or is that
something else?Later

     hard-linked and both are ""copied"", then the ""copies""
     are also hard-linked.  this is true of all `cpio's
     (and `tar' and any other decent/usable archival tool,
     by definition (IMHO)).  2. `cpio -p' (at least `GNU cpio version 2.4.2') will only
     read/write (copy) the actual data bytes once.  I _think_
     this is true for all `cpio's (not just that GNU version),
     but am not certain. if you use an intermediate archive, e.g.:    cpio -o ... >file;   ...;   cpio -i ... <file then the actual data bytes are copied into the archive (file)
 under each name (e.g., as both F1 and F2).  but GNU `cpio' is
 smart about this in pass-through mode (`-p'), copying the data
 just once (or so I read the source).cheers!

    anytime soon (e.g., never; i.e., time isn't a major issue),
    and are not using any intermediate media/file (so storage
    isn't an issue), then even if `cpio' did read the data twice,
    so what? --- as long as, of course, it re-creates the hard
    links.  which it will.--

 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media. the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not ""saved"" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a ""large"" blocking factor is used.)cheers!

evidence to the contrary. I thought the original question was a bit
strange...On that note: is there any real benefit to using hard links? I avoid them as
a rule, and cannot think of any good reason to use them at the moment.- Matthew

the process. Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.Cheers,	John Gay

  |  the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always

 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-( the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links. I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-( anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb. using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ sorry.  cheers!

 having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,
 yer in quite good company! there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor
 ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and
 is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such
 thing as a broken link. I use this fact on occasion to ""save"" data, via the well-
 known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file
 I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the
 ""temporary"" file does not destroy the data.

Or point me in the direction of a site that does GPL case studies where there may be a similar issue. I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.The setup is as follows:
I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
my knowledge, GPL. The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  
use a different service provider but keep my code. 
Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciatedAnt--

periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not
have hard links.That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever, you still have
a link under "".unwanted""Another script can then periodically clear out enough old files to ensure
that there is usually enough disk space.Although this sounds like a horrible hack. It would no doubt be much better
to have a transaction oriented file system with a rollback facility.  :)- Matthew

4494,"I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to 
build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for  compiling programs.Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to 
the kernel code.Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of 
matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, 
I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, 
so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage 
of the MMX processor.Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even 
more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or 
do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian 
compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?I am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they 
take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? 
And would this require re-building gcc as well?I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I 
would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the 
kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking 
for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX 
M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another 
I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the 
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing 
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch 
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not 
had much luck.Cheers,	John Gay--

 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea. but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites. ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the

  then vanished? --- over the years.... ) one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.cheers,

  | That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as
  | equally broken, rather than standing up and saying ""how about
  | we try & make everyone better"". eh?  POSIX doesn't ""do"" anything.  POSIX is a de jour
 specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
 encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely
 no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
 to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
 some ""POSIX-compatibility"", but that's a freely-made choice. IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
 has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider ""formal""
 submissions of ""proven"" technologies.  that translates into
 specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
 implementations which actively contribute to the process.
 most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
 proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
 implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,
 this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.) OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
 it can be argued the above ""weakness"" is a strength ....  | (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck) yep.  which is not to say POSIX ""sucks"" per se.  but the old
 pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
 of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
 perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
 porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
 from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
 different triple. however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
 between ""consider porting"" and ""actually porting"" --- and
 some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
 assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but
 others were Frustrating ""system"" incompatibilities --- the
 motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,
 Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.     Â«The nice thing about standards is there's so many to

  |[ ... ]
  | It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
  | program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output
  | of cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:
  | 
  |    mkfifo io
  |    cmd1  io
  | 
  | and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
  | suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
  | can be done using something like:
  | 
 1|    exec 3>&1
 2|    cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
 3|    exec 3>&-
  | 
  | but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
  | incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions?  [ ... ] the above, or something close to it, would work if, when the
 1st line is executed, file descriptor (fdesc) 1 is open for both
 read and write (R/W) to a suitable entity (e.g., a pipe/FIFO; I
 imagine a socket or something of that ilk could be made to work
 but have no idea why you'd want to go to the trouble.... ). but in any case, all that is unlikely to be the case:
  Â· most probably, fdesc 1 is yer tty (e.g. screen + keyboard);
 and
  Â· quite possibly is open only for write (being stdout). you need it open for R/W because all dup2(2) --- which is all
 `n>&m' means -- does is replicate the fdesc handle.  it does not
 change the access mode; e.g., if the original fdesc (m) was only
 open for writing (W), that's all the new fdesc (n) is open for.
 yet in the 2nd line, it's needed for both R (cmd1) and W (cmd2). whilst it's impossible to say for certain from this excerpt, it
 seems a reasonable guess that fdesc 1 when the 1st line executes
 is the stdout of the script itself, which is most probably yer
 tty.  that means, if it does happen to be open for R/W (which is
 the case on some systems), `cmd2' would be writing to the screen
 whilst `cmd1' is reading from the keyboard --- i.e., the poor
 confused human luser is ""clearly"" expected to manually echo back
 to the computer what it prints. good luck!  ;-) upshot:  the FIFO is needed.  and this isn't a shell scripting
          problem per se. the FIFO solution is fine.  I've used variations (plural) on
 this approach to extend the Korn (ksh(1)) shell language, by
 providing a co-processing interpreter --- `ksh' sends certain
 predefined commands to the co-process, handling control over
 to the co-process until it indicates processing is complete
 and `ksh' can resume normal processing.  with some thought and

Hi Kevin,In the past when administering large domains, I've used the DNSTool -
http://www.gormand.com.au/tools/dnstool/guide.htmlOne custom change I made to this tool was to modify it so that it used a
combination of OpenSSH and sudo for remote commands, file transfers, etc.This may, or may not be what you're after - I'm presuming that you're
considering writing a tool to do the maintenance of the domains?Regards,
  Andrew

  | From: ""Matthew French"" 
  |[ ... ]
  | Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the ""Deleted Items"" folder.
  | 
  | In the root of a hard drive, create a directory "".unwanted"".
  | Then periodically create hard links to every file on the hard
  | drive that does not have hard links.
  | 
  | That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever,
  | you still have a link under "".unwanted""  [ ... ] hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea. but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites. ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various ""versioning"" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... ) one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.cheers,

	Last night, i was involved in an epic struggle to write a shell
script to do a certain task. The battle raged for hours, but, i'm glad
to inform you, i emerged victorious. The problem was as follows:
	It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output of
cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:	mkfifo io
	cmd1  io
	
and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
can be done using something like:	exec 3>&1
	cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
	exec 3>&-but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions? Anyway, victory is
mine, and i is happy person once again. In case you were wondering, the
aim of all of this was to write a shell script that could check for new
mail on an imap server.Steve

The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference
between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard
links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more
the files ""real"" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you
end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

links, whereas Bill Joy and co. at Berkeley implemented soft links,
five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do
cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly
classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the
resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they
were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the
target file was deleted. For a better design for similar ideas, see
the MacOS.--

arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at
all cut and dried.However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I
developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to
shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a
vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of
the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't
take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him
that I was right and would most likely win in court.So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for
the GPL issues. Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself
covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps
not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which
Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of
your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever
you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and
you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another
service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR
code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then
distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified
code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to
PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when
locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about
any Linux box - 540 on this box)b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.
Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or
in part.> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciatedMicrosoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply
that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and
it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?Niall--

again, copy back you confs and voila.
All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
complicated as possible ;--)Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
hassle down the line. Only kidding but thats what I would do.CW----------------
OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
will need to be reinstalled.  So:1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave2. rpm -ivh glibc--i386.rpm
3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
4. rpm -ivh kernel--i386.rpmThis installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs--i386.rpm
2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs--i386.rpmfixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.Thanks guys...> [snip]

i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.

4514,"A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One 
person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on 
another list and got a few answers, most were ""don't even think about it"" but 
a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.After having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to 
give it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-)The lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or 
GlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the 
site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time?So, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this:Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var 
and /home.
Install a base Debian system into the /home  partition so I can build the 
rest of the system into the other partitions.
Using Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll 
try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage.
chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs.
strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot 
from / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition.All going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is 
fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC.Now I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with 
the various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE.If all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can 
find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got.I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.Cheers,	John Gay--

to any other destination port other than 443 (by default).  So the sshd 
has to be listening on port 443. PuTTy's proxy support is a bit flaky 
right now, the raw connects are a bit flaky aswell, I can't get them 
to work with certain revisions of IOS becuase they use different prompts
and success strings, gah! I havnt played with the SOCKS proxy support
much yet, but it's there.If you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :)
PuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and
currently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your 
session to get killed by the proxy.  Netcat send keepalives
which prevent this :)# 
# call as http_proxy_tunnel host port
#
function http_proxy_tunnel()
{
	mkfifo in.fifo	( echo CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1 
          echo HOST: $1:$2

	  echo 
          cat in.fifo ) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read ; read ; nc -lp  > in.fifo )
}
course that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be
doable natively, then again if you have cygwin, use OpenSSH and it's
excellently configurable proxycmd :)--

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and

someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2

wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...Conor

since the i386 was the CMOV introduced with the Pentium Pro. gcc 2.95 
will use that instruction if directed to with -march=pentiumpro and you 
will generally get a few percent improvement out of it. Code compiled 
with that option will fail on Pentium and earlier processors.> The Pentium also

> faster than equivulent code that performs the same function!That's the art of instruction scheduling - rearranging the instructions 
generated by the compiler such that they make best use of the parallel 
(""superscalar"") pipelines present in a modern CPU. gcc 2.95 has a fair 
go at scheduling according to the -mcpu=pentium/pentiumpro option. gcc 
3.1 does a better job, and fine tunes for a few more processors such as 
athlon and athlon-xp. They're in the process of replacing the compiler's 
instruction scheduling with a whole new mechanism that should do an even 
better job, but that's a ways down the road yet in gcc 3.3.As for the exotic extra instructions sets, gcc 3.1 will make use of SSE 
or SSE2 instructions instead of 387 instructions if you use the 
-mfpmath=sse option and you may see some speed benefit from it, but 
there's a chance you may also see incompatibilities. gcc will still use 
i387 code for missing functionality in the SSE instruction set (double 
precision floats for example).AFAIK no current gcc will ever use MMX or 3DNOW! instructions though gcc 
3.1 enables user code to explicitly generate these instructions with C 
code. The kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets to get super-fast 
block copies of memory or RAID math but not much else.> Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed 
> improvements rather than any execution changes.P4 introduced SSE2, a _MUCH_ improved version of SSE and a viable 
replacement for i387 FPU code. SSE supports only single precision floats 
while SSE2 can handle doubles. MMX and SSE shared registers with the FPU 
which hobbles them a bit, but SSE2 has its own large, dedicated register 
file. So far P4 is the only CPU equipped with SSE2. AMD's x86-64 CPUs 
are said to have it as well. Of course x86-64 itself is a whole other 
ball game...Paul.--

> Subject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2
(gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel 
platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't
wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to
change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a 
higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.Therefore:    export CFLAGS=""-O3 -march="" &&
    CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGSThis is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all
platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific
instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this
binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations 
that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems 
the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by 
even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching 
GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try 
using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user 
apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not 
prepared to go to this length.For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object 
pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it 
and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm 
still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been 
several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.Cheers,	John Gay--

you just do a save as, and set the extension to .gif - you should
get a dialog asking whether you want to merge visible layers or
save as an animation. I believe that you can also specify the
extension as .mpg or .mpeg if you've got the mpeg plug-in built.Cheers,

diary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:
 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :((Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...L.

ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading
ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once
you've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them
and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is
about before.It's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over
another, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the
learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know
what I'd prefer, as a beginner.This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've
been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped
on the bandwagon.--

Rizzo, who's one of the FreeBSD whizzes.  All three of the BSD's
packaged IPFilter, which has been around for donkeys years and which has
a slightly different feature set to ipfw.However, last year the author of IPFilter (Darren Reed) changed the
license on development branches of ipfilter to prohibit redistribution,
although official releases would still be kept under the old license. 
This policy got up the nose of Theo de Raadt (lots of things do, which
is why OpenBSD exists in the first place), so OpenBSD re-invented the
wheel and called their firewall ""pf"", under a full-time BSD license.   The standard release versions of ipfilter are unencumbered, as always.> Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE

only been mfc'd last wednesday.  It certainly adds some nice syntactic
sugar, and is apparently much faster for certain types of complex
rulesets.  It will be good once it's had some time to settle down a
little.>>i've no experience of ipfw. (closest i've come is looking at IPFilter

has some nice features like the ability to save and restore state so
that connections are persistent across reboots, and its logging is
marginally better organised than ipfw's.  It's also very mature code,
which appeals to the rather conservative tastes of my old age.Nick--

Hi all,I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different
reasons), and I'd prefer not to mix them up. So I was wondering
if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail (apart from list
mail, which I have already sorted) which arrives to a certain
e-mail address have the From: header in the reply automatically
set to the address it came to.For example, say I have a company, and sales@company.com,
info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox.
I don't want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the From:
set to dave@company.com, I would like the mail to come from
sales@company.com.Is there any way to do this? Bearing in mind that mail can arrive
with my email in the To or Cc fields (and Bcc?), and it might be
buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...Cheers,
Dave.--

do this very neatly - you set up multiple ""Identity"" profiles, each
with a distinct email address (and other things if desired, like a GPG
key and a signature).  You can then set up KMail to use various
identities automatically when replying to messages which match a
particular pattern, or which are in a particular folder, etc.  It's
all very cool, and it works very nicely.But I still don't know how to do it in Mutt.             Colm--

Some of the mailto links on our web site forward to me. When I reply to
someone who writes to one of these aliases, I prefer to keep the mail alias
as the From: address in my reply. For example, when someone sends email to
coolapps@linuxcare.com to suggest a program for me to review [pardon the
blatant plug...], it forwards to me. When I hit reply, the From: line in
the email will contain coolapps@linuxcare.com instead of my main address
bneely@linuxcare.com. My .muttrc file accomplishes this with two lines:set alternates = ""kbeditor@linuxcare.com|coolapps@linuxcare.com""

ilug folder for ilug mail, the doolin folder for doolin mail, etc.
so i use folder-hooks to accomplish that.  as an example (i do line
wrapping to keep it less then 80 chars long - spacing is important):folder-hook . ""my_hdr From: kevin lyda ;""\
""my_hdr X-GPG-Fingerprint: 9C1D 16F4 11F1 6BD2 933C  048D ACC7 9840 89D0 7646;""\

folder-hook /(alphyra|Alphyra/[^.].*) \
""my_hdr From: kevin lyda ;my_hdr X-GPG-Fingerprint: ""\
""088E 2BC4 381E 990A 1E0E  1DA0 4D44 99EF 20E6 38A0;""\

""set folder=~/Mail/Alphyra;set record=~/Mail/Alphyra/outbox;""\
""set postponed=~/Mail/Alphyra/postponed""you could also do this with send hooks.  i use them to tweak gpg settings:send-hook .			""unset pgp_autoencrypt;set pgp_autosign""

Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to
the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can
start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this
might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence
to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby
active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is
a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that
basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the
resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a
bootp and tftp server somewhere....hth,
Ronan.

me. coz I have pretty much no Irish at all, although my wee Girl starts

either ability or inability in a language something to be proud
of... maybe it's just me, but I'm not proud that I can't speak
Italian, no more than I'm proud that I can speak French or
English.Cheers,

proud of not knowing something. It's like the tourist on holidays using
that speak-loudly-enough-and-they-will-understand technique or (slightly
less off-topic) the friend or relative who says ""I know nothing
about computers!"" and clearly doesn't intend to learn, and is happy
to let you clean up after them.I certainly agree that Irish is not taught all that well (or wasn't
when I was in school) but I'd like to be able to relearn it and to
count it as one of my skills.David--

  Oops.
Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting in the other
reader hanging around forever.... not realising that never-opened-for-reading
and opened-and-later-closed might be different.  Sensible behaviour has now been
observed.

mpeg2enc generates stats during the run, so I give each one an xterm.Thanks,

""fdisk /mbr"" will not destroy the OS, it will simply restore the windows
mbr as it was.  Running fdisk and deleting a partition would however
destroy the OS (bu even then only if you format the disc afterwards).

fdisk /mbr will restore a dos MBR.. it'll leave the partitions alone.linux fdisk and deleting all partitions will actually leave LILO in the
MBR though.L.

     http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/ whilst the list is nominally about UTF-8/Unicode and Linux,
 it often delves into related areas (such as input methods). my (vague!) understanding of the state-of-play is there are
 multiple ways of keyboarding scripts such as ""Chinese"", and
 the choice of method is a mixture of personal preference,
 equipment (e.g. your keyboard), and the tool/application
 in question. w.r.t. X11 applications, it seems to boil down to two
 approaches:   one unique to the tool itself (apparently
 `yudit' is famous for this);  or  else using what's called
 an XIM (X Input Method).  WARNING: I am now guessing quite a bit here, based mostly on
           my interpretation of what I've read whilst lurking,
           and watching a few people keyboarding a Japanese
           script years ago!   *** your mileage will vary! *** XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend.  i.e., you
 build up your character as a series of composes of the root or
 fundamental strokes (""radicals"", I think they are called), and
 then ""commit"" the composite character to the application.
 ( yes, keyboarding these scripts _is_ quite slow, I believe
  a good typist can only do a few characters a minute!
  and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. ) some XIMs compose ""in place"", others do it on a special line,
 and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).
 also, some(/most?) XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input
 mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,
 which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which
 apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---
 implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII
 input mode (what us English-speakers would call ""normal""
 keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).
 I'm not sure, but I have the impression the switch is often
 a toggle, and something like . many apologies if this is completely wrong or too misleading.cheers!

of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
""forced"" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)Nick--

of a lot better than a few chars per minute.  For example, the
simplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out
each character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example,
Zhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong',
then you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the
most common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for
the second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3.You can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that
much different to English.  However, until you get familiar
with the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can
be a little slow.Other input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the
phonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost
always pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is
'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to
the possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent
'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd
enter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible
matches.I think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where
you can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only
use that when you know the character you want but you don't
know how to pronounce it.>

Input Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC.Regarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me
on Red Hat 7.2o  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The
   fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable
   Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMso  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging
   in.Everything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in
your GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the
menus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your
way around.Use Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When 
in Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't
understand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use
Ctrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space.Fire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and 
you'll see the Chinese for China.Getting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left
as an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput
and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.Later,

 There is no canonical test, and the information is not necessarily
 available. If you check out how struct stat is defined on your system,
 you'll find that only     time_t   st_atime;    /* Time of last access */
     time_t   st_mtime;    /* Time of last data modification */
     time_t   st_ctime;    /* Time of last file status change */
                           /* Times measured in seconds since */
                           /* 00:00:00 UTC, Jan. 1, 1970 */ are available. File status change = i-node status change, it includes
 creation, mode change, ownership change etc., so this is what you want
 only if the file status wasn't changed since creation. This information is also shown by ls -lc, but parsing ls' output requires
 a bit of effort. I'd rather recommend to write a short C program to access
 the file status directly, and output the ctime directly (seconds since
 the epoch, i.e. perfect for numerical comparison). (Another way is to use GNU find -printf with a custom format:
  ...
            %c   File's last  status  change  time  in  the  format
               returned by the C `ctime' function.
 ...)

4605,"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
but that didn't help. I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
the agent).In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is belowdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT

This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home

Subject: [ILUG] Dell GX260 V Redhat 7.3
Hi,
We just got some new Dell GX260 machines here are work and I'm supposed to
be putting Linux on them. I tried installing RedHat 7.3. It just didn't want
to know about the graphics card. I's an onboard Intel DVMT chip. No
dedicated memory, it takes it from the onboard RAM.I was wondering if anybody had gotton these machines and had any luck
getting this graphics card working?When this graphics card didn't work, I installed a PCI Diamond Stealth 64
VRAM card. Xconfigurator auto-detected this and my 21"" SUN monitor no
problem but whenever it tries to test the configuration it fails and the
screen is left with a blue background and all of the text is blue.
Does anybody have any idea what the problem is or how to fix it?
Cheers,

Hi,I've installed Quake 3 onto my computer and it starts to run up ok but as
soon as the graphics start it bails out.  It complains that there is an
error in sis_drv.o,  the line before this says that it is starting Quake in
24 bit depth, now from http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsis630.shtml I
understand that the sis630 won't do 24 bit depth.  So is there a way to make
Quake start up in 16 bit depth?  I've done some ""google""ing but drawn a
blank.....ThanksGreg

any are going to give you problems with a specific distribution/version.
With Dell just check the support.dell.com site, match the system, look for
downloadable drivers. From these if there aren't any linux drivers you can
usually find out the chipset of each device. Plug them into google with
""linux"" and see what people have to say about them. Generally speaking when
you buy the system you'll be told the make/model of each device rather than
the chipset, so further investigation is necessary.	The cavaet, of course, is always to know exactly what you're buying.
In most people's cases unfortunately it's not the person who bought the
systems that will be configuring them.steve

When I get a box I don't want any of that integrated chipset crap 
whether its for winblows or linux. Its just like IBM (mwave dsp chip ?)
(shared video/main memory ?)in the old days. I know you can flip a 
mboard jumper switch to turn crap off and install your own cards 
but why bother ?To clarify my point is this ....
Dell makes excellent machines and I would recomend their machines and 
their aftersales support over any other manufacturer that I can think of.
However if you want that box for linux and you have a life and you dont
want to spend a week of it fucking arround and googling to get that box
working properly be damned sure you do your research before you buy it.
And this especially applies to their budget machines.And this isn't taking a swing at you John but ...>>Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of

Absolutely, to buy a machine and hope later that linux will take to it is
beyond naive. There is a lot of support, mailing lists, web sites, etc that
will help people decide if Linux is going to like a box or not, use them.> (without a net connection/56k modem). And the machine has got

You make it sound that incompatibility has been deliberately built into the
new systems. The products that any company sell with linux installed will be
easily reinstalled with linux. The products sold with Windows only may not
be. Having said that I've never found a Dell system it was impossible to put
RH on. I have had one or two headaches in the past doing it, though.steve

changing DefaultDepth to 16 (in /etc/X11/XF86Cnfig-4), and restarting X.
Letting us know what distro you're using would help too.Steve

Where does cron log to? (check /etc/syslog.conf) Usually it's something like /var/log/cron.log or /var/log/cron Anyways have a look in the logs, make sure your backup ran (so long
as there weren't any errors).Typically if there's any output from the commands you've run,
they're mailed to you.--

original copy of the MBR must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
Which is exactly what I didn't have.  The installation of Linux
Mandrake didn't afford me that luxury.Also, I'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --
previously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
This is obviously not the case.--

decent brand will be know about by XFree setup programs in modern
distributions. However, if you have the budget (insurance paying for the
dead monitor, perhaps ? - and WHERE was your monitor that it got caught in a

a DVI out video card then, too. DVI provides a much better picture than VGA
because it removes the analog stage - basically DVI gives you a direct
connection from video ram pixels to monitor pixels - the best pictures I've
ever seen on a computer is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn't
use DVI, but an internal connection which has the same effect). Brand wise,

  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.  Ronan.

There's a switch statement in the program on argv[0].It's not including any options in the link.L.--

This is exactly what you need when you are administering a large

your life on Dells website and messing around with drivers
